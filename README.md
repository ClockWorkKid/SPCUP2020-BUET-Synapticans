# SPCUP2020-BUET-Synapticans
This repository contains the project files containing our approach towards solving the problem statement of IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2020

There are four main parts to the project, 'final_submission' contains all the final versions of the codes, an overall solution process to the project. In order to understand how to use the files, head to that folder and see the README

The 'Technical Report.pdf' file contains details of our algorithm for solving the problem statement and relevent experimentations, result and discussion.
